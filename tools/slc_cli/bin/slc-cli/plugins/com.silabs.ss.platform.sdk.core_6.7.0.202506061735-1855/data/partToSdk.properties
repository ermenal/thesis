# This is a standard properties file. The keys are part ids to space separated lists of stack/sdk keywords. 
# The order of the stack/sdk keywords will determine which stack/sdk is more preferred per part. Those will
# be chosen over any other stacks/sdks if they exist. 
# Currently stacks add their framework ids as keywords.
