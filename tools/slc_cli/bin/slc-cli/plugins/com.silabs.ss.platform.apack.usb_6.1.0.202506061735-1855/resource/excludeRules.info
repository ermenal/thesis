This file lists the default rules for which vendor ids and 
product ids are going to be included in the list of studio devices.

The format is following:
  * VID or PID reads as hex, if it starts with '0x', decimal otherwise.
  * Line "-VID:PID" means to explicitly exclude VID:PID
  * Line "+VID:PID" means to explicitly include VID:PID
  * Line "-VID" means to explicitly exclude vendor id VID
  * Line "+VID" means to explicitly include vendor id VID
  * Line "+" means to include everything else.
  * Line "-" means to exclude everything else.
  * Any line that doesn't match the pattern is ignored.
