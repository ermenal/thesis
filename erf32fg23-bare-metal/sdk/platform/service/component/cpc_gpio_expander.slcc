description: >
  The Co-Processor Communication (CPC) General Purpose Input/Output (GPIO) Expander is a
  software component designed to enable a CPC Primary/Host device to utilize a Secondary
  device's GPIOs as if they were its own. With the CPC GPIO Expander, the Primary/Host
  device can seamlessly integrate with the Secondary device and make use of its GPIO
  capabilities. This component is dependent on specific pieces of software on the
  Primary/Host device to facilitate this communication. By enabling this communication,
  the CPC GPIO Expander expands the capabilities of the Primary/Host device, allowing
  it to interface with a wider range of devices and peripherals.
