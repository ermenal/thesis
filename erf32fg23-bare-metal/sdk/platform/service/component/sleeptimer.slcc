description: >
  The Sleeptimer driver provides software timers, delays, timekeeping and date
  functionalities using a low-frequency real-time clock peripheral. Sleep Timer
  uses one Hardware Timer and creates multiple software timer instances.
  Sleep Timer can be used for creating timers which are tightly integrated with power
  management. The Power Manager requires precision timing to have all clocks ready on
  time, so that wakeup happens a little bit earlier to prepare the system to be ready
  at the right time.
