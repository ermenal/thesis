description: >
  The BGAPI UART DFU (Non-Secure) component provides DFU (device firmware upgrade) for Bluetooth applications
  using the BGAPI protocol. A GBL image containing the new firmware is written to the target device using UART as
  the physical interface and BGAPI protocol. The BGAPI UART DFU bootloader is a standalone bootloader, so no
  storage area needs to be configured. During UART DFU upgrade the bootloader writes the new firmware image
  directly on top of the old firmware image and therefore no temporary download area is needed.
