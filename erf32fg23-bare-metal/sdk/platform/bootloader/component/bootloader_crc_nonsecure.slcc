description: >
  The Cyclic Redundancy Check component provides software implementations of 16-bit and 32-bit
  cyclic redundancy check (CRC). It is compatible with trustzone non-secure bootloaders.
  A cyclic redundancy check (CRC) is an error-detecting code commonly used
  to detect accidental changes to digital data. Blocks of data entering these systems get a short
  check value attached, based on the remainder of a polynomial division of their contents. On retrieval,
  the calculation is repeated and, in the event the check values do not match, corrective action can be
  taken against data corruption.
