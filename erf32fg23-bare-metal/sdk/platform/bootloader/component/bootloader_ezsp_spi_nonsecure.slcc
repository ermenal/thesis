description: >
  The Bootloader EZSP-SPI (Non-Secure) component provides a EZSP protocol over SPI. This component makes a bootloader
  that is compatible with the legacy 'ezsp-spi-bootloader' that was previously released with the EmberZNet and
  Silicon Labs Thread wireless stacks. This component can be used for firmware upgrade over SPI using the EZSP protocol.
  pinout should be configured in the SPI Peripheral component.
