description: >
    The LWIP http high layer application component can be used for LWIP http high layer application specifically
    programmed with the lwIP low-level raw API, this httpd supports for a rudimentary server-side-include
    facility which will replace tags of the form in any file whose extension is .shtml, .shtm or .ssi with
    strings provided by an include handler whose pointer is provided to the module via function http_set_ssi_handler().
    Additionally, a simple common gateway interface (CGI) handling mechanism has been added to allow clients to
    hook functions to particular request URIs.
