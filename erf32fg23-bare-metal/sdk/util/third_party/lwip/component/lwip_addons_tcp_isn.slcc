description: >
  The TCP Initial Sequence Numbers component can be used to generate Initial Sequence Numbers add-on for a new
  TCP connection. Initial sequence numbers (ISN) refers to the unique 32-bit sequence number
  assigned to each new connection on a Transmission Control Protocol (TCP)-based data communication.
  It helps with the allocation of a sequence number that does not conflict with other data bytes
  transmitted over a TCP connection.
