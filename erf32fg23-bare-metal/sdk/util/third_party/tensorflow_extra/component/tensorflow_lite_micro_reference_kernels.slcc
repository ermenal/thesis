label: Reference Kernels
description: >
  This component includes the available reference kernel implementations used
  with TensorFlow Lite for Microcontrollers. The reference kernels are pure C/C++
  implementations, and do not include any platform-specific optimizations.

  If any other kernel implementation components are included in the project,
  each included kernel will replace the corresponding reference kernel implementation.
