description: >
  The Application Core component aims at providing utilities common to most Wi-SUN applications. 
  A Wi-SUN connection helper function sl_wisun_app_core_network_connect() configures the network size setting, the TX output power, the certificates, and keys. 
  The last function action is to start the Wi-SUN connection process. 
  The app_wisun_network_is_connected() function provides a simple connection status getter too.
  Event handlers for basic Wi-SUN network events component includes the basic event handler implementations.
  The sl_wisun_app_core_get_current_addresses() function retrieves known IPv6 addresses.
  Use sl_wisun_app_core_get_state() function to get the status of the Stack API calls.
  To use the component in your application, add it to your project and initialize it with app_wisun_core_init().
