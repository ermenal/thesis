description: >
  The Ping component implements a ping service based on the ICMPv6 protocol. 
  The component is able to send ICMPv6 packets, receive the associated responses, and compute the round-trip latency. 
  Using the sl_wisun_ping_request() API, an application emits a single ping packet. 
  To receive the pong response, the application can then call the sl_wisun_ping_response() API.
  The sl_wisun_ping() function provides a simple solution to periodically send and receive ping packets. 
  To stop the process, call the sl_wisun_ping_stop() function. 
  A ping test is configurable in size, number of pings sent, and timeout if a response is not received.
  To initialize the component, call sl_wisun_ping_init() function.
