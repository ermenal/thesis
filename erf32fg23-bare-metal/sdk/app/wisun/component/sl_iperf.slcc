description: > 
  The iPerf component provides an iPerf2 (https://sourceforge.net/projects/iperf2/)-compatible solution to measure UDP throughput. 
  It has a full UDP support, and implements a server and client modes, which are capable of sending and receiving packets to measure the bandwidth performance, the inter-arrival jitter, and packet loss.
  The component relies on different functions to help configure and run your iPerf test. 
  It allows you to set up your server and client port, your preferred bandwidth, number of packets, remote peer address, and so on. 
  At the end of every iPerf test, an iPerf report is output. 
  The component can be used with any network stack because it has a portable custom network interface.
  To use the iPerf component in your application, add it to your project and initialize it with sl_iperf_service_init().
