package: platform
description: >
  Timer service based on FreeRTOS with static memory allocation
  for applications with less strict timing requirements.
  This module is based on the sleeptimer, but runs the timer callbacks in
  non-interrupt context. This behavior gives more flexibility for the callback
  implementation but causes a less precise timing.
  If your application requires precise timing, please use the sleeptimer
  directly.
