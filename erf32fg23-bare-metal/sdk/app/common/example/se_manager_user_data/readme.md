# SE Manager User Data

This example uses the SE Manager API to perform the erase and write operations of the user data section on the supported Series 2 device.

The example redirects standard I/O to the virtual serial port (VCOM) of the kit. By default, the serial port setting is 115200 bps and 8-N-1 configuration.

The example has been instrumented with code to count the number of clock cycles spent in different operations. The results are printed on the VCOM serial port console. This feature can be disabled by defining `SE_MANAGER_PRINT=0` (default is 1) in the IDE setting (`Preprocessor->Defined symbols`).

## Getting Started

1. Upgrade the kit’s firmware to the latest version (see `Adapter Firmware` under [General Device Information](https://docs.silabs.com/simplicity-studio-5-users-guide/latest/ss-5-users-guide-about-the-launcher/welcome-and-device-tabs#general-device-information) in the Simplicity Studio 5 User's Guide).
2. Upgrade the device’s SE firmware to the latest version (see `Secure Firmware` under [General Device Information](https://docs.silabs.com/simplicity-studio-5-users-guide/latest/ss-5-users-guide-about-the-launcher/welcome-and-device-tabs#general-device-information) in the Simplicity Studio 5 User's Guide).
3. Open any terminal program and connect to the kit’s VCOM port.
4. Create this platform example project in the Simplicity IDE (see [Examples](https://docs.silabs.com/simplicity-studio-5-users-guide/latest/ss-5-users-guide-getting-started/start-a-project#examples) in the Simplicity Studio 5 User's Guide).
5. Build the example and download it to the kit (see [Simple Build](https://docs.silabs.com/simplicity-studio-5-users-guide/latest/ss-5-users-guide-building-and-flashing/building#simple-build) and [Flash Programmer](https://docs.silabs.com/simplicity-studio-5-users-guide/latest/ss-5-users-guide-building-and-flashing/flashing#flash-programmer) in the Simplicity Studio 5 User's Guide).
6. Run the example and the console should display the process steps of this example.

## Additional Information

1. The default optimization level is `Optimize for debugging (-Og)` on Simplicity IDE and `None` on IAR Embedded Workbench.

### SE Manager API

The following SE Manager APIs are used in this example:

* `sl_se_init`
* `sl_se_deinit`
* `sl_se_init_command_context`
* `sl_se_deinit_command_context`
* `sl_se_erase_user_data`
* `sl_se_write_user_data`

## Troubleshooting

### Serial Port Settings

Be sure to select the following settings to see the serial output of this example:

* 115200 Baud Rate 
* 8-N-1 configuration
* Line terminator should be set to "None" if using Device Console in Simplicity Studio

### Programming the Radio Board

Before programming the radio board mounted on the mainboard, make sure the power supply switch is in the AEM position (right side) as shown below.
