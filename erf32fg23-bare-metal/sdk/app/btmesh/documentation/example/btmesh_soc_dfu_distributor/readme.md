# Bluetooth Mesh - SoC DFU Distributor

Device Firmware Update (DFU) is a feature introduced in the Bluetooth Mesh Model specification v1.1 that provides a standard way to update device firmware over a Bluetooth mesh network. The **Bluetooth Mesh - SoC DFU Distributor** example demonstrates a Bluetooth mesh node playing the DFU Distributor role responsible for delivering new firmware images to the Target nodes and monitoring the progress of the firmware update. The Distributor acts as an intermediary on behalf of the Initiator so that the Initiator does not always need to be present on the mesh network. Firmware image delivery is performed using the BLOB Transfer models.


This example requires one of the Internal Storage or SPI Flash Storage Bootloader variants depending on device memory and board hardware capabilities. The Distributor stores update images in bootloader storage slots and therefore the storage slot size must be big enough to store update images.

## Getting Started

To learn Bluetooth mesh technology basics, see [Bluetooth Mesh Network - An Introduction for Developers](https://www.bluetooth.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Mesh-Technology-Overview.pdf).

To get started with Bluetooth Mesh and Simplicity Studio, see **QSG183: Bluetooth Mesh SDK Quick-Start Guide for Bluetooth Mesh 1.1**.

The term SoC stands for "System on Chip", meaning that this is a standalone application that runs on the EFR32/BGM and does not require any external MCU or other active components to operate.

This is an example of a Bluetooth Mesh DFU Distributor application. To perform firmware updates with the Distributor, an Initiator, e.g. the Silicon Labs Bluetooth Mesh mobile app, is required as well as  the device firmware update target(s). For more information on the DFU examples, see **AN1370: Bluetooth® Mesh Device Firmware Update Example Walkthrough**. To learn the basics of the Bluetooth Mesh Device Firmware Update specification, see **AN1319: Bluetooth® Mesh Device Firmware Update**.

The example has the Distributor functionality enabled by default because the following components are installed:

- Firmware Distribution Server
- Firmware Update Client
- BLOB Transfer Client

The example also has the Target node functionality enabled by default because the following components are installed:

- Firmware Update Server
- BLOB Transfer Server

To learn more about programming an SoC application, see [UG472: Silicon Labs Bluetooth ® Mesh Configurator User's guide for SDK v2.x](https://www.silabs.com/documents/public/user-guides/ug472-bluetooth-mesh-v2x-node-configuration-users-guide.pdf).

[UG295: Silicon Labs Bluetooth ® Mesh C Application Developer's Guide for SDK v2.x](https://www.silabs.com/documents/public/user-guides/ug295-bluetooth-mesh-dev-guide.pdf) gives code-level information on the stack and the common pitfalls to avoid.

## Troubleshooting

Note that Software Example-based projects do not include a bootloader. However, they are configured to expect a bootloader to be present on the device. To install a bootloader, from the Launcher perspective's EXAMPLE PROJECTS & DEMOS tab either build and flash one of the bootloader examples or run one of the precompiled demos. Precompiled demos flash a bootloader as well as the application image.

- To flash an OTA DFU-capable bootloader to the device, flash the **Bluetooth Mesh - SoC Switch** demo.
- To flash a UART DFU-capable bootloader to the device, flash the **Bluetooth Mesh - NCP Empty** demo.
- For the parts that support the DFU Distributor role and have less than 1 MB of internal flash, the SPI Flash Storage Bootloader is flashed with the demo.
- For other bootloader types, create your own bootloader project and flash it to the device before flashing your application.
- When you flash your application image to the device, use the *.hex* or *.s37* output file. Flashing *.bin* files may overwrite (erase) the bootloader.
- On Series 1 devices (EFR32xG1x), both first stage and second stage bootloaders have to be flashed. This can be done at once by flashing the *-combined.s37* file found in the bootloader project after building the project.
- For more information, see [UG103.6: Bootloader Fundamentals](https://www.silabs.com/documents/public/user-guides/ug103-06-fundamentals-bootloading.pdf) and [UG489: Silicon Labs Gecko Bootloader User's Guide for GSDK 4.0 and Higher](https://cn.silabs.com/documents/public/user-guides/ug489-gecko-bootloader-user-guide-gsdk-4.pdf).

Before programming the radio board mounted on the mainboard, make sure the power supply switch is in the AEM position (right side) as shown below.
