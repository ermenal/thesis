description: >
  This Component initializes the Generic Server and Client Models which are added to the project
  as components and provides an interface to register handlers for their events.
  Note that the Generic Base Component alone does not add support for Generic Models
  (e.g. Generic OnOff Server/Client, Generic Level Server/Client, etc), that has to be done from
  another component or application software.
  This component is prepared for integration into SOC applications.
