description: >
  Color Tunable Lighting (CTL) Client model. Used to set the dim level or the
  color temperature of a light source (CTL Server) on another node.

  This component extends the lighting client with functions to change the
  temperature by, or to change the temperature to a certain percentage.

  For more details about lighting please see Lighting Client.
  This component is prepared for integration into SOC applications.

  This is a Low-Code component. For example, changing all CTL Server nodes' color
  temperature by 1 percent can be achieved by adding an event handler for mesh
  events and calling the following code:

  #include "sl_btmesh_ctl_client.h"

  void event_handler(sl_btmesh_msg_t *evt)
  {
    case sl_btmesh_evt_node_initialized_id:
      if (evt->data.evt_node_initialized.provisioned) {
        sl_btmesh_change_temperature(1);
      }
    break;
  }
