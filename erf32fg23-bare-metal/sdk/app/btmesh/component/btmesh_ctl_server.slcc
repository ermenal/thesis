description: >
  Color Tunable Lighting (CTL) Server model. Used to support the control and
  reporting functionality of a node with a light source that is dimmable and whose
  color temperature can be selected.

  This component implements this control and reporting functionality, extending
  on lighting server, and also provides callbacks on lighting related events.

  For more details about lighting, please see Lighting Server.
  This component is prepared for integration into SOC applications.

  This is a Low-Code component. The following weak callbacks are available to
  implement the relevant light source handling:

  void sl_btmesh_lighting_level_pwm_cb(uint16_t level);
  void sl_btmesh_lighting_color_pwm_cb(uint16_t color);
