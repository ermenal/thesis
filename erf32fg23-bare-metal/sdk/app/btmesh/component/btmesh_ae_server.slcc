description: >
  Advertisement Extension Server component enables the Silabs Configuration Server vendor model for the node to allow data
  transfer over Advertisement Extension. This is a proprietary feature which breaks compliance with AE in
  BT Mesh 1.1 specification.
  Mesh data over Advertisement Extension can be used in message-heavy applications (e.g. Device Firmware Update) to
  speed up data transfer between nodes. All nodes must have the Silabs Configuration Server vendor model enabled, and a
  Silabs Configuration Client (enabled by e.g. the Advertisement Extension Client component) must configure the clients
  to use Advertisement Extension.
  This component is prepared for integration into SOC applications.

  This is a No-Code component.
