  Lightness Control (LC) Server model. Used to support the control and reporting
  functionality of a node with a light lightness controller that can monitor
  occupancy and ambient light level sensors and adjust the dim level of a light.
  LC Server extends Lightness Server model and Generic OnOff Server. It also has
  a corresponding LC Setup Server model which is present in the same element.
  This component is prepared for integration into SOC applications.

  This is a No-Code component when added to an existing project using Light
  Lightness Server.
