description: >
  The Event Logging is an application-level software module that
  logs stack events. Its main purpose is to log application related stack events.
  Both Bluetooth LE and Bluetooth mesh events are handled by the Event Logging
  component. This component is suitable for use in both NCP and SOC applications.

  This is a No-Code component (UART communication can be enabled/disabled 
  in the Platform/Board Control software component).
