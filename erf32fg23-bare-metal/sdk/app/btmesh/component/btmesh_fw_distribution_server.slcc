description: >
  Provides BT Mesh Firmware Distribution Server functionality, defined in mesh
  specification.

  This model is used by the Distributor to receive from the Initiator the
  firmware update parameters, the set of Target nodes to update, and the
  firmware image to transfer. This model uses the Firmware Update Client model
  and the BLOB Transfer Client model to manage the firmware update. The Firmware
  Distribution Server can transfer one firmware image at a time.
  This component is prepared for integration into SOC applications.

  This is a No-Code component.
