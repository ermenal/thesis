package: Btmesh
description: >
  Provides BT Mesh Firmware Update Client functionality, defined in mesh
  specification.

  The Firmware Update Client model is used by the Distributor and Initiator.
  This component is prepared for integration into SOC applications.

  The Initiator uses this model to retrieve the information about the firmware
  subsystems installed on the Target node, and to get the location of the new
  firmware images. The Initiator receives the list of Target nodes from the
  higher-layer application.

  The Distributor uses this model to start a firmware image transfer to the
  Target nodes. The Distributor receives the list of Target nodes from the
  Initiator. The Distributor uses the procedures on the Firmware Update Client
  model with the inputs to these procedures being chosen by the Firmware
  Distribution Server.

  This is a No-Code component.
