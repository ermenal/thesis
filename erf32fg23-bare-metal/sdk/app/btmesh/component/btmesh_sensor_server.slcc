label: "Sensor Server"
package: "Btmesh"
description: >
  Used to support the reporting functionality of a node with a set of sensors
  whose data is available on the network. It also has a corresponding Sensor
  Setup Server model which is present on the same element.

  This component implements temperature, people count, and illuminance measurements.
  It provides callback functions for each property.
  This component is prepared for integration into SOC applications.

  This is a No-Code component if using a Silicon Labs device and the relevant
  components for their respective hardware.
