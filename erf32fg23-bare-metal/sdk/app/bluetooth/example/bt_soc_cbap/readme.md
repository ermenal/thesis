# SoC - Certificate-Based Authentication and Pairing

This example application demonstrates how to create secure connections with trusted devices, where the trust between the devices is based on device certificates instead of some classical authentication method like numeric comparison or passkey entry. This method ensures authenticated connections without any user interaction. A signed device certificate must be present on the devices.

> **Note: This example project is at EXPERIMENTAL quality level and is not meant to be used in production!**

> Note: this example expects a specific Gecko Bootloader to be present on your device. For details see the Troubleshooting section.

## Getting Started

To get started with Silicon Labs Bluetooth and Simplicity Studio, see [QSG169: Bluetooth® Quick-Start Guide for SDK v3.x and Higher](https://www.silabs.com/documents/public/quick-start-guides/qsg169-bluetooth-sdk-v3x-quick-start-guide.pdf).

This example is based on device certificates. To learn about device certificates, refer to [AN1268: Authenticating Silicon Labs Devices Using Device Certificates](https://www.silabs.com/documents/public/application-notes/an1268-efr32-secure-identity.pdf). To generate a device certificate for your device, run the **Bluetooth - SoC CSR Generator** sample app before running this sample app. To learn the usage of the CSR Generator, refer to its readme file.

Certificate-based authentication and pairing means that device A will only make a pairing/bonding with device B if device B can present a valid device certificate signed by a central authority (CA) that device A knows and trusts. Similarly, device B will only accept the pairing from device A if device A can present a valid device certificate signed by a CA that device B knows and trusts. The device certificates are validated using the CA certificate (or root certificate) that is also stored on both devices.

After the devices have exchanged and validated each others' certificates, they create an authenticated secure connection using OOB (Out-Of-Band) data, where the OOB data is signed by the devices' private keys and validated with the device certificates. This ensures that the devices not only have the certificates but also have the corresponding private keys, which guarantee the devices' identity.

Certificate-based authentication and pairing is useful in situations where multiple devices must create authenticated connections between each other without any user interaction.

## Testing the Example

This example application works only if the elliptic curve (EC) key pair, the device certificate and the root certificate are present on the device. These can be generated using the CSR Generator. Before using this example application, make sure you have properly-signed certificates present on your device. For further information read the readme file of the **Bluetooth SoC - CSR Generator** sample app.

In a pairing example two devices are needed: a central and a peripheral. This example is written so that it can act both as the central and as the peripheral device. In the central role, the device looks for the peripheral, connects to it, initiates certificate-based authentication and pairing, and finally writes a characteristic that can only be written via an authenticated connection. In the peripheral role, the device accepts connections, participates in certificate-based authentication and pairing and finally turns on an LED when its dedicated characteristic is written. The role can be defined in the project configuration.

To test the example:
1. Connect two devices to your PC.
2. Make sure you have run the CSR generator on both devices, so that you have an EC key pair and a signed device certificate on both devices. See the readme of the CSR Generator.
3. The CA certificate must be stored in the application, so you must copy the generated `sl_bt_cbap_root_cert.h` file into this project, under the */config* folder.
4. Build this example and flash it to one of the devices.
5. Open the slcp file of this project.
6. On the Overview tab, under Project Details, open the three-dots-menu, and click **Configuration**.
7. Change the Role from Peripheral to Central.
6. Build the project again and flash it to the other device.
7. Open a terminal program and connect to both devices to see their debug messages.
8. Reset both devices. The central will automatically connect to the peripheral and after some seconds you should see the LED on the peripheral turning on.

## Troubleshooting

### Bootloader Issues

Note that Example Projects do not include a bootloader. However, Bluetooth-based Example Projects expect a bootloader to be present on the device in order to support device firmware upgrade (DFU). To get your application to work, you should either 
- flash the proper bootloader or
- remove the DFU functionality from the project.

**If you do not wish to add a bootloader**, then remove the DFU functionality by uninstalling the *Bootloader Application Interface* software component -- and all of its dependants. This will automatically put your application code to the start address of the flash, which means that a bootloader is no longer needed, but also that you will not be able to upgrade your firmware.

**If you want to add a bootloader**, then either 
- Create a bootloader project, build it and flash it to your device. Note that different projects expect different bootloaders:
  - for NCP and RCP projects create a *BGAPI UART DFU* type bootloader
  - for SoC projects on Series 1 devices create a *Bluetooth in-place OTA DFU* type bootloader or any *Internal Storage* type bootloader
  - for SoC projects on Series 2 devices create a *Bluetooth Apploader OTA DFU* type bootloader

- or run a precompiled Demo on your device from the Launcher view before flashing your application. Precompiled demos flash both bootloader and application images to the device. Flashing your own application image after the demo will overwrite the demo application but leave the bootloader in place. 
  - For NCP and RCP projects, flash the *Bluetooth - NCP* demo.
  - For SoC projects, flash the *Bluetooth - SoC Thermometer* demo.

**Important Notes:** 
- when you flash your application image to the device, use the *.hex* or *.s37* output file. Flashing *.bin* files may overwrite (erase) the bootloader.

- On Series 1 devices (EFR32xG1x), both first stage and second stage bootloaders have to be flashed. This can be done at once by flashing the *-combined.s37* file found in the bootloader project after building the project.

- On Series 2 devices SoC example projects require a *Bluetooth Apploader OTA DFU* type bootloader by default. This bootloader needs a lot of flash space and does not fit into the regular bootloader area, hence the application start address must be shifted. This shift is automatically done by the *Apploader Support for Applications* software component, which is installed by default. If you want to use any other bootloader type, you should remove this software component in order to shift the application start address back to the end of the regular bootloader area. Note, that in this case you cannot do OTA DFU with Apploader, but you can still implement application-level OTA DFU by installing the *Application OTA DFU* software component instead of *In-place OTA DFU*.

For more information on bootloaders, see [UG103.6: Bootloader Fundamentals](https://www.silabs.com/documents/public/user-guides/ug103-06-fundamentals-bootloading.pdf) and [UG489: Silicon Labs Gecko Bootloader User's Guide for GSDK 4.0 and Higher](https://cn.silabs.com/documents/public/user-guides/ug489-gecko-bootloader-user-guide-gsdk-4.pdf).


### Programming the Radio Board

Before programming the radio board mounted on the mainboard, make sure the power supply switch is in the AEM position (right side) as shown below.
