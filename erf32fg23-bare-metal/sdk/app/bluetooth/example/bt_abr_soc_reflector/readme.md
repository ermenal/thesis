# SoC - ABR reflector

The Bluetooth SoC-ABR reflector is a project that you can use to test the Accurate Bluetooth Ranging feature. In the provided ABR setup, the reflector measures the phase of the received signal and sends this information back to the initiator. The initiator will calculate the distance, the measured values are not available on the reflector side.

## Getting Started
Bulid and flash the sample application.
After startup it will advertise the name "ABR Example", and will provide the "ABR Test Service" over GATT.


## Troubleshooting

This sample application does need a bootloader. Updating the software is only possbile via reflashing the code.
