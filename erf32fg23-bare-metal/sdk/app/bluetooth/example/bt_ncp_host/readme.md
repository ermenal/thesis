# NCP - Host

This is a reference implementation of an NCP (Network Co-Processor) host, which is typically run on a central MCU without radio. It can connect to an NCP target via UART to access the Bluetooth stack of the target and to control it using BGAPI.

This  example uses the Dynamic GATT feature, and it must be used together with the **Bluetooth - NCP** target app.

> Note: this example expects a specific Gecko Bootloader to be present on your device. For details see the Troubleshooting section.

## Getting Started

To get started with Silicon Labs Bluetooth software and Simplicity Studio, see [QSG169: Bluetooth SDK v3.x Quick-Start Guide](https://www.silabs.com/documents/public/quick-start-guides/qsg169-bluetooth-sdk-v3x-quick-start-guide.pdf).

In the NCP context, the application runs on a host MCU or PC, which is called the **NCP host**, while the Bluetooth stack runs on an EFR32, which is called the **NCP target**. This example application demonstrates an NCP host implementation. Although it is written for an EFR32 device, it can be ported to other MCUs.

The NCP Host and Target communicate via a serial interface (UART), which can be tunneled either via USB or via Ethernet if you use a development kit. The communication between the NCP host and target is defined in the Silicon Labs proprietary protocol called BGAPI. BGLib is the reference implementation of the BGAPI protocol in C, to be used on the NCP Host side.

[AN1259: Using the v3.x Silicon Labs Bluetooth Stack in Network Co-Processor Mode](https://www.silabs.com/documents/public/application-notes/an1259-bt-ncp-mode-sdk-v3x.pdf) provides a detailed description how NCP works and how to configure it for your custom hardware.

The following figure shows the system view of NCP mode:

## Configuring the Host and Target

Use this example application with an NCP target application that is run on another mainboard.

1. Create the NCP target firmware for another mainboard on which you want to run the Bluetooth stack:

    1. Create a new **Bluetooth - NCP** example project.
    2. In the Project Configurator, find the **UARTDRV USART** component.
    3. Add a new instance with the name 'exp'. This will root the UART pins to the EXP header of the mainboard instead of vcom.
    4. Remove the 'vcom' instance.
    5. Find the **Board Control** component.
    6. In its configuration, disable Virtual COM UART.
    7. Build and flash the project to the target mainboard.

2. Build the NCP - Host project and flash it to the mainboard.

3. For UART communication, the TX and RX pins of the host mainboard need to be connected to the RX and TX pins of the target mainboard, respectively. Make sure the following connections are established:

    - *TX* pin (number 12 on the expansion header of the mainboard) of the host is connected to the *RX* pin (number 14 on the expansion header of the mainboard) of the target.

    - *RX* pin (number 14 on the expansion header of the mainboard) of the host is connected to the *TX* pin (number 12 on the expansion header of the mainboard) of the target.

    - *VMCU* pin (number 2 on the expansion header of the mainboard) of the host is connected to the *VMCU* pin (number 2 on the expansion header of the mainboard) of the target.

    - *GND* pin (number 1 on the expansion header of the mainboard) of the host is connected to the *GND* pin (number 1 on the expansion header of the mainboard) of the target.

4. On the host, set the power supply switch into *AEM* position (the kit is powered via USB). On the target, set the power supply switch into *BAT* position. The red rectangles on the previous image show the position of the power supply switches on the host and the target. The VMCU and GND pins are used to power up the NCP target.

5. Power the NCP host via USB. The NCP host will receive the boot event from the NCP target. The host will send an advertiser_start command to the target. As a result, you should see your NCP target device advertising itself as a Silicon Labs Example.

## Extending the Host Code

The Bluetooth event handler in app.c of the NCP host project works the same way as the Bluetooth event handler in app.c of any SoC project. The difference is in the background. The NCP host project sends the command to the target device, while an SoC project executes the command on the SoC device.

## Extending the GATT Database

The Host can build up the GATT Database on the Target in runtime with the APIs provided by the Dynamic GATT Database component.

The Dynamic GATT Database APIs can be used for:

- Adding / Removing services, characteristics and descriptors.
- Modifying service, characteristic and descriptor properties.
- Maintaining a polymorphic GATT, where the database can be updated at any time.

This example demonstrates building a minimal GATT database. This can be extended by adding further services using the dynamic GATT API.

See the Bluetooth API reference manual section "GATT Database" for more details.

## Troubleshooting

### Bootloader Issues

Note that Example Projects do not include a bootloader. However, Bluetooth-based Example Projects expect a bootloader to be present on the device in order to support device firmware upgrade (DFU). To get your application to work, you should either 
- flash the proper bootloader or
- remove the DFU functionality from the project.

**If you do not wish to add a bootloader**, then remove the DFU functionality by uninstalling the *Bootloader Application Interface* software component -- and all of its dependants. This will automatically put your application code to the start address of the flash, which means that a bootloader is no longer needed, but also that you will not be able to upgrade your firmware.

**If you want to add a bootloader**, then either 
- Create a bootloader project, build it and flash it to your device. Note that different projects expect different bootloaders:
  - for NCP and RCP projects create a *BGAPI UART DFU* type bootloader
  - for SoC projects on Series 1 devices create a *Bluetooth in-place OTA DFU* type bootloader or any *Internal Storage* type bootloader
  - for SoC projects on Series 2 devices create a *Bluetooth Apploader OTA DFU* type bootloader

- or run a precompiled Demo on your device from the Launcher view before flashing your application. Precompiled demos flash both bootloader and application images to the device. Flashing your own application image after the demo will overwrite the demo application but leave the bootloader in place. 
  - For NCP and RCP projects, flash the *Bluetooth - NCP* demo.
  - For SoC projects, flash the *Bluetooth - SoC Thermometer* demo.

**Important Notes:** 
- when you flash your application image to the device, use the *.hex* or *.s37* output file. Flashing *.bin* files may overwrite (erase) the bootloader.

- On Series 1 devices (EFR32xG1x), both first stage and second stage bootloaders have to be flashed. This can be done at once by flashing the *-combined.s37* file found in the bootloader project after building the project.

- On Series 2 devices SoC example projects require a *Bluetooth Apploader OTA DFU* type bootloader by default. This bootloader needs a lot of flash space and does not fit into the regular bootloader area, hence the application start address must be shifted. This shift is automatically done by the *Apploader Support for Applications* software component, which is installed by default. If you want to use any other bootloader type, you should remove this software component in order to shift the application start address back to the end of the regular bootloader area. Note, that in this case you cannot do OTA DFU with Apploader, but you can still implement application-level OTA DFU by installing the *Application OTA DFU* software component instead of *In-place OTA DFU*.

For more information on bootloaders, see [UG103.6: Bootloader Fundamentals](https://www.silabs.com/documents/public/user-guides/ug103-06-fundamentals-bootloading.pdf) and [UG489: Silicon Labs Gecko Bootloader User's Guide for GSDK 4.0 and Higher](https://cn.silabs.com/documents/public/user-guides/ug489-gecko-bootloader-user-guide-gsdk-4.pdf).


### Programming the Radio Board

Before programming the radio board mounted on the mainboard, make sure the power supply switch is in the AEM position (right side) as shown below.
