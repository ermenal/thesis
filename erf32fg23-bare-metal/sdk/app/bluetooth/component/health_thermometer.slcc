description: API for the Health Thermometer GATT service

  This is a Low-Code component. At start, the temperature sensor has to be
  initialized. Once the BLE connection is established, the

  sl_bt_ht_temperature_measurement_indication_changed_cb()

  function will be called where either a single measurement can be done,
  or a timer started. A reference implementation for this function can be
  found in Bluetooth - SoC Thermometer example, in app.c file. The result
  of the measurement can be send using

  sl_bt_ht_temperature_measurement_indicate()

  function.
