# LED Bulb

The Z-Wave LED Bulb application shows an implementation of a remotely controlled color 
switch. An example is a LED bulb or any other color capable device.

The LED Bulb application is based on:

| Basic Report (Current Value, Duration) | Multilevel Switch Report (Value, Duration) |

## Association Groups

The following association groups shown in the table below are available for Z-Wave and Z-Wave Long 
Range respectively.

<table>
<tr>
    <th>ID</th>
    <th>Name</th>
    <th>Node Count</th>
    <th>Description</th>
</tr><tr>
    <td>1</td>
    <td>Lifeline</td>
    <td>X</td>
    <td>
        <p>Supports the following command classes:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Device Reset Locally: triggered upon reset.</li>
            <li>Color Switch Report: Triggered when the switch changes state.</li>
            <li>Multilevel Switch Report: Triggered when the switch changes state.</li>
            <li>Indicator Report: Triggered when LED1 changes state.</li>
        </ul>
    </td>
</tr>
</table>

X: For Z-Wave node count is equal to 5 and for Z-Wave Long Range it is 1.

## Usage of Buttons and LED Status

To use the sample app, the BRD8029A Button and LEDs Expansion Board must be used. BTN0-BTN3 and LED0-LED3 refer to the buttons and LEDs on the Expansion Board.

The following LEDs and buttons shown in the next table below are used.

<table>
<tr>
    <th>Button</th>
    <th>Action</th>
    <th>Description</th>
</tr><tr>
    <td>RST</td>
    <td>Press</td>
    <td>Resets the firmware of an application (like losing power). All volatile memory will be cleared.</td>
</tr><tr>
    <td rowspan="2">BTN1</td>
    <td>Press</td>
    <td>
        Enter "learn mode" (sending node info frame) to add/remove the device.<br>
        Removing the device from a network will reset it.
    </td>
</tr><tr>
    <td>Hold for at least 5 seconds and release</td>
    <td>Perform a reset to factory default operation of the device, and a Device Reset Locally Notification Command is sent via Lifeline.</td>
</tr>
</table>
