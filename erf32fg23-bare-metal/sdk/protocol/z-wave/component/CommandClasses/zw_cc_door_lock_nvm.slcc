description: >
  This component provides the non-volatile memory interface for the Door Lock Command Class. 
  Besides the Read and Write functionalities, a migration API is also present. This aids
  the migration process - which requires updating the NVM - when coming from an SDK version that is
  older than 7.19.0.
