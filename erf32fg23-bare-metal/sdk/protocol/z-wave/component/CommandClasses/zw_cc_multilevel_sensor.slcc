description: >
  The Multilevel Sensor Command Class is used to advertize numerical sensor readings. The
  Multilevel Sensor Get Supported Sensor Command is used to request the supported Sensor Types
  from a supporting node. The Multilevel Sensor Supported Sensor Report Command is used to
  advertize the supported Sensor Types by a supporting node. A controlling node MUST always show
  the sensor reading values even if the Sensor Type and/or Scale is unknown.
  Note that this Command Class supports advanced configuration.
  To use it, please make sure that configuration related to your project is added to cc_config file located in
  <app_location>/config/cc_config/<app_name>.cc_config.
  See protocol/z-wave/ZAF/tool/cc_configurator/README.md for more details.
