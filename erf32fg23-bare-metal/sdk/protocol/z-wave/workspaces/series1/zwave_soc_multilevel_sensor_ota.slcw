  Demonstrates Switch Multilevel Sensor application combined with OTA bootloader. 
  The Z-Wave Switch Multilevel Sensor application shows the ability to advertize 
  numerical sensor readings, such as temperature and humidity, and so on. 
  Multiple parameters can be set for the minimum and maximum values, and a 
  notification will be sent if the measured temperature value is out of the range.
