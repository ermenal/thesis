# Power Strip

The Z-Wave certified Power Strip application shows an extension block implementation used to turn on 
several devices that are connected to power. Examples include lights, appliances, etc.

The Power Strip Z-Wave certified application implements several endpoints, which can be controlled 
individually.

The Power Strip application is based on:

| <!-- -->                 | <!-- -->                                     |
| ------------------------ | -------------------------------------------- |
| Role Type                | Always On End device (AOS)                   |
| Supporting Device Type   | Actuator                                     |
| Device Type              | Binary Switch                                |
| Generic Type             | Switch Binary                                |
| Specific Type            | Not Used                                     |
| Requested security keys  | S0, S2_UNAUTHENTICATED, and S2_AUTHENTICATED |
| Endpoint 1 Device Type   | Binary Switch                                |
| Endpoint 1 Generic Type  | Switch Binary                                |
| Endpoint 1 Specific Type | Not Used                                     |
| Endpoint 2 Device Type   | Multilevel Switch                            |
| Endpoint 2 Generic Type  | Switch Multilevel                            |
| Endpoint 2 Specific Type | Not Used                                     |

Power Strip supports the "push mode" only of Notification CC and transmits the following notification 
types/events:
- Power Management
  - Overload detected (both endpoint 1 and 2)

## Association Groups

The following three tables show the available association groups for Z-Wave and Z-Wave Long 
Range respectively.
Backward compatibility for non-Multi Channel devices forces the root device AGI table to contain all the 
association groups mentioned in each of the endpoints AGI tables except from group 1, the Lifeline 
group.

### Association groups for Root Device:

<table>

    <th>ID</th>
    <th>Name</th>

## Firmware Update

This section will describe backward compatibility when upgrading the Power Strip application from one SDK to a newer version. 

SDK 7.1x is the first SDK running on Z-Wave 700.
