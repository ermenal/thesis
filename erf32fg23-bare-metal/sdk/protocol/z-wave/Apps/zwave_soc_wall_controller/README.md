# Wall Controller

The Z-Wave certified Wall Controller application shows a push-button switch panel implementation to control devices in the Z-Wave network from push buttons (physical or virtual) on a device that is meant to be mounted on a wall. Examples include scene and zone controller and wall-mounted AV controllers.

The Wall controller application implements a wall-mounted switch that has three individually configurable buttons. Each button has support for on/off and dimming.

The Wall Controller application is based on:

Use case:

The wall controller's three buttons are configurable to control nodes. Each button action is sent over the Lifeline as scene actions.

## Basic Command Class mapping

Basic Command Class is not mapped to any of the supported command classes.

## Association Groups

The following association groups are available for Z-Wave and Z-Wave Long Range respectively.

X: For Z-Wave node count is equal to 5 and for Z-Wave Long Range it is 1.

Y: For Z-Wave node count is equal to 5 and for Z-Wave Long Range it is 0.

## Usage of Buttons and LED Status

To use the sample app, the BRD8029A Button and LEDs Expansion Board must be used. BTN0-BTN3 and LED0-LED3 refer to the buttons and LEDs on the Expansion Board.

The following LEDs and buttons shown in the next table below are used.
