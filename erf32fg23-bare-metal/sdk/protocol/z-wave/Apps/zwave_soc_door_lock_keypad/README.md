# Door Lock

The Z-Wave certified Door Lock application shows a lock implementation. It supports user codes to open a door and thereby eliminate the need for traditional keys. It is possible to both lock and unlock the door remotely through the Z-Wave protocol.

The Door Lock application is based on:

| <!-- -->                | <!-- -->                                                                |
| ----------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Role Type               | Listening Sleeping End device (LSS / FLiRS)                             |
| Supporting Device Type  | Actuator                                                                |
| Device Type             | Lock                                                                    |
| Generic Type            | Entry Control                                                           |
| Specific Type           | Door Lock                                                               |
| Requested security keys | S0 and S2_ACCESS<br>The Door Lock features depend on the security level |

The application will only work when securely added to a network by a controller supporting security.
The controller MUST support security S2_Access_Control or S0 in order to be able to control the door lock.

**Not** implemented Door lock functionality:

- Timed Operation mode
- Door Lock condition
- Inside Door Handle State
- Functionality handling Lock timeout
- Target mode
- Auto-Relock, Hold And Release, Block to Block, and Twist Assist

## Usage of Buttons and LED Status

To use the sample app, the BRD8029A Button and LEDs Expansion Board must be used. BTN0-BTN3 and LED0-LED3 refer to the buttons and LEDs on the Expansion Board.

The following LEDs and buttons shown in the next table below are used.

<table>
<tr>
    <th>Button</th>
    <th>Action</th>
    <th>Description</th>
</tr><tr>
    <td>RST</td>
    <td>Press</td>
    <td>Resets the firmware of an application (like losing power). All volatile memory will be cleared.</td>
</tr><tr>
    <td>BTN0</td>
    <td>Button up/down</td>
    <td>
        If the outside door handle state is active:<br>
        Button down sets the outside door handle mode active.<br>
        Button up sets the outside door handle mode inactive.
    </td>
</tr><tr>
    <td rowspan="2">BTN1</td>
    <td>Press</td>
    <td>
        Enter "learn mode" (sending node info frame) to add/remove the device.<br>
        Removing the device from a network will reset it.
    </td>
</tr><tr>
    <td>Hold for at least 5 seconds and release</td>
    <td>Perform a reset to factory default operation of the device, and a Device Reset Locally Notification Command is sent via Lifeline.</td>
</tr><tr>
    <td>BTN2</td>
    <td>Button press</td>
    <td>Sends Battery Report.</td>
</tr><tr>
    <td>BTN3</td>
    <td>Button press</td>
    <td>
        Simulates entering a user code on a keypad.<br>
        The entered user code is hard-coded with the value of the default user code of the application. The default user code is 1234.<br>
        A valid user code entry (i.e., button press) toggles the Door Lock Mode between Secured and Unsecured,<br>
        with a delay of 2 seconds, to simulate timed hardware operation.<br>
        If the user code for user ID 1 is changed to something else than the default user code, the Door Lock Mode can no longer be toggled by pressing this button.<br>
