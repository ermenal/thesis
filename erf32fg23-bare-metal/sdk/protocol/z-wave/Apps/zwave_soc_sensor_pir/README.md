# Sensor PIR

The Z-Wave certified Sensor PIR application shows a presence/movement detector implementation for controlling other devices and for sending notifications.

| Role Type                 | Reporting Sleeping End device (RSS)       |
| Supporting Device Type    | Data reporting                            |
| Device Type               | Notification sensor                       |
| Generic Type              | Sensor Notification                       |
| Specific Type             | Notification Sensor                       |
| Requested security keys   | S2_UNAUTHENTICATED, and S2_AUTHENTICATED  |

Sensor PIR transmits the following notification types/events:

-   Home Security
    -   Motion detection (unknown location)

Sensor PIR supports the "push mode" only of Notification CC.

## Supported Command Classes

Sensor PIR implements mandatory and some optional command classes. The table below lists the supported Command Classes, their version, and their required Security class, if any.

## Usage of Buttons and LED Status

To use the sample app, the BRD8029A Button and LEDs Expansion Board must be used. BTN0-BTN3 and LED0-LED3 refer to the buttons and LEDs on the Expansion Board.

The following LEDs and buttons shown in the next table below are used.

<sup>1</sup>: A Radio Board is plug-in board for the Wireless Pro Kit Mainboard.
A Thunderboard is a stand-alone kit with a direct USB Type-C connection.

Note : BTN0 press works only on the 800 series and has no effect on the 700 series. This is due to the differences in the silicon. The BTN0 press is able to wake up the 800 series from EM4 mode where as this is not possible for the 700 series.

## Firmware Update

This section will describe backward compatibility when upgrading the Switch On/Off application from one SDK to a newer version.

SDK 7.1x is the first SDK running on Z-Wave 700.
