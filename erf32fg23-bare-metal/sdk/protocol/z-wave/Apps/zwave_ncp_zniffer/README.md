# Zniffer

The Zniffer is a development tool for capturing Z-Wave RF communication and sending the frames to a host application.

Z-Wave Zniffer is a PC side host application which communicates with the Zniffer via a USB serial connection and presents the frames in a graphical user interface.
This enables Z-Wave developers to analyze unsecured/secured and 9.6/40/100kbps/Long-Range RF communication between Z-Wave nodes.
